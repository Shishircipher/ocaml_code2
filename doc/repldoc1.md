To run this OCaml code in a `.ml` file, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create the `.ml` file**:
   Create a new file named, for example, `example.ml` and add your code to it:
   ```ocaml
   let some_or_default default = function
     | Some x -> x
     | None -> default;;

   some_or_default 3 (Some 5);;

   List.map ~f:(some_or_default 100) [Some 3; None; Some 4];;
   ```

2. **Install `core` (if you need `~f` syntax)**:
   The `~f` syntax for labeled arguments used in `List.map` is available in Jane Street's Core library. If you haven't already, you may need to install this library. You can install it via `opam`:
   ```bash
   opam install core
   ```

3. **Compile and run the code**:
   You can run the code in two ways:

   - **Using OCaml REPL**: Open the OCaml REPL and load your file.
     ```bash
     ocaml
     ```
     Then load the file within the REPL:
     ```ocaml
     #use "example.ml";;
     ```

   - **Using `ocamlc` with `core`**: Compile and run the code directly from the command line.
     ```bash
     ocamlfind ocamlc -package core -linkpkg example.ml -o example
     ./example
     ```

4. **Run the code**:
   After compiling, you should see output based on the code. For example, this code will use `some_or_default` to handle the optional values in the list.
how ~f syntax for labeled arguments is implemented in ocaml ?
